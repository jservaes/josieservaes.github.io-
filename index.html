            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Josie Servaes, a Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a passion for building elegant, user-focused software. I’m currently developing my skills in both backend and frontend development, API integration, and web design. I love solving real-world problems with code and am always looking for ways to make systems smarter, more efficient, and more human-centered.

              <h3>Software Development Intern</h3>
                <p><em>Company Name (e.g., ClearRock) — Summer 2025</em></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Worked under the supervision of Nicolas Robbe to create software solutions for client companies.</li>
                  <li>Gained hands-on experience with REST APIs and GUI development.</li>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Payroll Automation</h3>
                <p>A Python-based software I developed for ClearRock to streamline the payroll process. It pulls time entries from QuickBooks Time via API, matches them with employee pay rates, and generates payroll-ready reports for each pay period. I also created a custom GUI to allow anyone in the company to run payroll with no technical knowledge.</p>
                <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Flask, REST APIs, Excel</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Database Cleaner</h3>
                <p>A data-cleaning and structuring project for Elder Resource Benefits Consulting. I audited and mapped their Salesforce databases, eliminating redundancy and reformatting data structures to align with form automation in Conga. This cleanup enabled more reliable VA form generation and simplified future data entry.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.servaesconsulting.com/" target="_blank">servaesconsulting.com</a> — I redesigned this website to modernize the layout and improve usability. I implemented conditional logic into the client intake form so that only relevant questions appear based on previous answers, reducing confusion and improving the user experience.</p>
